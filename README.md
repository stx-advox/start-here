# 🏁 start-here
The start-here channel on Advocates DAO discord. Available here for peer review and changes via collective conversation.

Hi 👋🏽
You've arrived at the Advocates DAO, welcome!
✨

Stacks Advocates DAO began as a representation of members advocating for education, implementation, and optimization of the Stacks ecosystem. This led to a group of 25 candidates formally selected to test SourceCred technology in alpha for several weeks before integration of the Advocates channel to the Stacks server.

🗓️

Today, the Advocates DAO is a fertile space for experimenting with commons and governance systems and the intersections between the two. We use SourceCred (SC) and PolicyKit (PK) implementations and work with a team of residents known as the Governance Lab Initiative to support further governance tooling with a focus on community engagement and participation.

⛰️

The goal of the Advocates DAO is to model decentralized systems of governance for the larger Stacks Ecosystem. Advocates act as a platform to voice the needs of the greater Stacks community. We invite all Stacks communities to have at least 1 delegate in the Advocates program to keep up with experimental and relational developments pertaining to governance including but not limited to reward systems. The Advocates identity continues to emerge daily through active participation and creative utilization of the discord platform.

🐁

Advocates DAO is a good use case to follow for organizations, such as foundations or other corporations, that are looking to decentralize. At the time of this writing, the rewards treasury for the Advocates DAO is 2000 STX/week distribution. 
🧮

Configurations of SourceCred: Contributors use the 💪│didathing thing and 🙌│props models: using these channels to incentivize describing work for reward through a standard template as well as praising each other for unseen labor using props. The greater the number of emoji reactions received on a post equals the greater reward for the contributions of our members. In this way, we are showing collective valuation for each other's work. There is a general channel for open discussion as well as more specific channels to discuss Cred and Grain uses and strategies.

Governance is a key convergence of the Advocates DAO within Stacks. Systems design for indigenous models of governance is being practiced and iterated on live in our community, in our server, and in our emergent tooling. You will see this through 🐢 (turtle), 🐺 (wolf), and 🧸 (bear) iconography, emoji-reacts, and dialogues around this three-tiered system of governance as they are being taught through the knowledge keeping of the Two Row Wampum Longhouse and iterated on by the Governance Lab and greater community of Advocates. This knowledge and practice is extrapolated from a 2k-year-old oral constitution and over 10k-year-old cosmology of the Kanienke’ha’ka (gah-nyen--geh-hah) of the Five Nations Confederacy.

Tutorial: How to become an advocate

Begin by familiarizing yourself with our [Code of Conduct Addendum to Stacks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2x7J9OogupOAZrZ42xb43QaM2Nf_0SOHWofBgaRxAs/edit#). It is a live document and we welcome feedback. We will update the document once our feedback mechanism is in place 🧘‍♂️ 

Introduce yourself in 👋│introductions. Tell us what community you're from, your interests, and what you're up to in the ecosystem or outside of it. We want to know you!

1️⃣ One way to become an advocate is to have someone 🤗│vouch for you

Use case: Roles @Stacks Advocates and Stacks @DAO & Moderation can mention people and those individuals are given a temporary advocates role in order to access all channels in the Advocates DAO.

Until you become a permanent Stacks Advocate no Cred weight will be assigned to your reactions to posts. This way, no reward will be received or given until the @StacksAdvocates role activates your account.

Once you are tagged in the 🤗│vouch channel please read the channel description for instructions 
➡️ After you post your first 💪│didathing  or 🙌│props  you will become an advocate.

- Post in didathing: But what counts as "athing"?
    - Anything you feel is good advocacy work:
    Sending a couple messages in a chat to help someone else is too light, but helping multiple people over a week is great.
    - A new blog post is great.
    - Post what you're comfortable with. We do a decent job of giving feedback as things move along.
- Here is the forum post for our current onboarding document for didathings:
    - [The Physics of Social Consensus](https://forum.stacks.org/t/the-physics-of-social-consensus/12202)
- Overall, Numbers (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣) are more objective rankings, meaning they are weighted at 1, 2, and 3 Cred respectively; so larger is better. Meanwhile animals (🐢 🧸 🐺) are more subjective interpretations and all animals are worth 2 Cred each. The animals relate to the different clan roles that Advocates learn to develop in relationship to as they learn about the 3-tiered protocol. All the emoji-reacts give a more nuanced and interpersonal take on a contribution, as it should be. Here is our first explainer to relate wolf-turtle-bear protocols to our ecosystem work and how to value and identify that work using emoji reacts! https://www.loom.com/share/555fd4478a2f4f47adce1829f3f9002b

2️⃣ Another way to become an advocate is to request to join in ✋│join-requests 

Before joining all Advocate DAO channels are viewable but most are read-only. Upon request a person from the Welcome Team can assign a temporary Advocates role to you (designated by a ✅), giving you access to post your first 💪│didathing  or 🙌│props  to become join the Stacks Advocates.

Please read the channel description in ✋│join-requests for instructions.
